## December 2025

I am taking the end of the year to reflect on my life, work, and personal projects. I am reviewing what I did and built, what worked, and what did not, while deciding what is worth continuing into the next year and what to leave behind.

By keeping my schedule intentionally light, most days are spent reading, writing, and cleaning up loose ends in existing projects rather than starting new ones. I am documenting things I usually rush past and removing work that no longer serves a clear purpose.

As I am building this portfolio website, the focus is on clarity, longevity, and reducing complexity. I am writing most of the content directly on the site as it evolves, including this page. The goal is a small, understandable website that reflects how I work and think, rather than a polished snapshot.

This will be a collection of small, focused pages rather than a single portfolio overview. It is meant encapsulate short entries that describe what I am working on, using, learning, or thinking about right now. Some sections are updated regularly, others exist only to capture a moment in time.
