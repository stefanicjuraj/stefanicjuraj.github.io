# Juraj Štefanić

**Software Engineer. Technical Writer.**

I am a software engineer and technical writer with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and Web & Mobile Computing from Rochester Institute of Technology.

I currently work as a technical content engineer at Daytona, where I blend my technical knowledge with my writing skills.

My background and [work experience](./work.md) includes software development, documentation, data engineering, and user experience. Learning and [hobby projects](./projects/index.mdx) I occupy my time with are an outlet for my creativity and serve as a great learning curve.
