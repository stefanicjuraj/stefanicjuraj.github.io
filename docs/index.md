# Juraj Štefanić

**Software Engineer. Technical Writer.**

I am a software engineer and technical writer with a Bachelor of Science (bacc.ing.techn.inf.) in Information Technology and Web & Mobile Computing from Rochester Institute of Technology.

Currently embracing the challenges and rewards as a Technical Writer (Documentation Engineer) at ReversingLabs, where I blend my technical knowledge with my writing skills.

With an interest and previous work experiences in software development and documentation, data engineering, user experience and user interface; learning and hobby projects I occupy my time with are an outlet for my creativity and serve a great learning curve.
