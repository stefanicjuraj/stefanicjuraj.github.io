I created a Minecraft Ultra Hardcore [(UHC)](#uhc) server ([EuroUHC](#eurouhc)) in 2013 to host private and public [UHC matches](#uhc).

## UHC

UHC (Ultra Hardcore) is a Player vs Player (PvP) game mode in Minecraft created by MindCrack, a team of players and a private Minecraft server founded in 2010 by Guude.

UHC is a competitive multiplayer mode, with players forming teams or competing individually in a tournament-style format. The mode is called "ultra hardcore" because it is played with the difficulty level set to the highest level: the absence of natural health regeneration, limited resources, and more challenging environment and mobs.

Players start with none to limited set of resources, and they cannot regenerate health naturally. The only way to regain health is through eating golden apples or drinking/splashing health potions, which can be crafted or found in the world. Players must be strategic in their approach to the game, managing their resources and health while exploring the world, mining for valuable resources, and battling other players.

Number of players that can participate a UHC game can vary depending on the hosting server's settings and capabilities. Generally, UHCs are played with anywhere from a few players to several hundreds (_or thousands_) players. UHC is designed to be challenging and resource-intensive, and having too many players can make it difficult for players to gather the resources they need to survive. Larger games may require additional resources and settings to ensure that the gameplay remains fair and balanced for all players.

Length of a UHC game can vary depending on the server and host's preference, but there are some typical timeframes: 30 - 45 minutes, 60 - 90 minutes, and 90 - 120+ minutes.

Different gamemodes and scenarios can be applied to configure, modify and change the flow of UHC by setting the team size, adding or removing challenges, game-specific rules and preferences.

Gamemode refers to the size of the player's team. Examples of gamemodes in UHC include FFA (_Free For All_), Teams of 2, Teams of 3,... or Random Teams.

Scenario refers to specific modifications or alterations to the standard UHC gameplay. Scenarios can add additional challenges or benefits to the gameplay and can be added to any of the gamemodes. Some popular (and my favorite) scenarios include:

- **CutClean**: Items requiring cooking/smelting drop their cooked/smelted variety on mine.
- **Blood Diamonds**: On mine of a diamond, the player takes 1 heart of damage.
- **BestPvE**: At the beginning of the game, all players are added to a list called "Best PvE". Every 10 minutes, the players on the list get healed by 1 heart. When you take damage, you leave the list, and the only way, to join once more, is to get a player kill.
- **TimeBomb**: On player kill, the player's loot explodes after a certain period of time.
- **Switcheroo**: On every bow and arrow shot, the player and the target switch places.
- **NoFall**: Players cannot take fall damage.
- **NoPvE**: Players cannot attack mobs.
- **Sky High**: After a certain period of time, players take damage every 30 seconds if they are below the surface level of 100 (Y: 100).
