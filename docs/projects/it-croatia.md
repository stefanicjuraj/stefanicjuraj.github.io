A collection of IT companies, conferences, education, certificates, communities, places to work, podcasts, and internships in Croatia.

I started this project in the early stages of my academic journey while exploring communities, conferences, and first job opportunities to start my career. As I entered the world of the IT industry, I decided to create a platform that could serve as a comprehensive resource for others starting (or continuing) their career paths.

The process of collecting data involves a combination of automatic and manual data extraction and filtering of publicly available sources. Automatic data collection is performed using a combination of custom web scraping tools and Python scripts, while manual data collection is performed by searching for information in the public domain.

The initial launch of the project was announced on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroIT/comments/1bfba43/kolekcija_it_kompanija_konferencija_edukacija/). I also shared it on LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and Bluesky to gain user traction and gather feedback from the community. As I had no prior experience with releasing public projects, the initial response was overwhelming but invaluable. The inputs I received helped shape the platform in many ways.

I even had an opportunity to answer a few questions about the project for my college's news website:

> [How Juraj Štefanić built it-croatia.com to guide the IT industry](https://www.rit.edu/croatia/hr/node/209004)
>
> _At its core, it-croatia.com serves as a centralized resource for the IT community in Croatia. “The idea is to provide a clear, structured, and continuously updated resource for IT professionals, students, and enthusiasts looking for companies to work for, events to attend, internships to apply for, or communities to join”, Juraj explained. The platform helps people explore the industry more efficiently and has been especially useful for students and job seekers._

After the initial launch, I focused solely on user feedback: adding more data and features, fixing bugs, and improving the user experience.

I also focused on studying project analytics and insights (heatmaps and session recordings), as I was interested in how users use the website.

While observing the heatmaps data — based on 200,000+ recorded interactions — the analysis reveals interesting patterns in user behavior.

Starting from the top of the page, nearly all users clicked the top-right notifications icon (🔔). I used this opportunity to explore how users instinctively react to notification-like elements, even when repurposed. In this case, the notification icon serves as a disguise for the changelog, drawing immediate attention to the latest updates and useful tips.

Desktop users frequently clicked on the search input field as their second action, indicating a clear intent to quickly locate specific information.

In contrast, mobile users interacted more with the table data filters to narrow down options efficiently, as scrolling through long lists on a smaller screen can be tedious. This behavior highlights the importance of providing intuitive filtering options for mobile users, who navigate differently due to touch-based interaction and limited screen space.

I tried a few tools: Vercel, Cloudflare, Google Analytics, Microsoft Clarity, and PostHog. At some point, I had all of them running, so I used a piece of paper to track the data from each.

What began as a personal effort to discover local companies, events, and opportunities has grown into a resource that I’m proud to see others actively use and benefit from.

People engage with the content, suggest improvements, and submit contributions, helping refine and expand the platform. I receive messages from people sharing how the project helped them find companies to work for, conferences to attend, and internships to apply for.

Building this project is teaching me a lot — from design, development, testing, and documenting to listening and learning from real user feedback. This process has pushed me to improve in many ways I hadn't anticipated.

I’m excited to see the project continue evolving and supporting the IT community in Croatia.
