An extension for advanced search functionality. The extension supports the following search categories:

- All: Search for everything
- Files: Search for filenames
- Text: Search for full-text content
- Symbols: Search for functions and variables
- Documentation: Search for documentation content
- Configuration: Search for configuration content
- Comments: Search for comments
- Pinned: Pin search results

I've been building a VS Code extension to make searching for files, text, functions, variables, documentation, configurations, and comments inside large projects more intuitive.

The built-in search works well and gets the job done, but when you’re working in a codebase with hundreds of files across different folders, it starts to feel too noisy. Everything is returned in one flat list, regardless of what you're trying to find.

This extension introduces more focused, categorized search that gives better control over what you’re trying to find. It’s still a work in progress but already proving useful in day-to-day work. Especially in larger projects, where knowing what you're looking for isn't the problem, but filtering out what you're not is.

You can now keep specific search results visible and accessible across sessions and projects, without having to retype or re-filter every time.

Useful for revisiting the same configurations, jumping back to key functions, or keeping references in view while working on features.

I posted my extension project on Reddit to get early feedback and suggestions, and did not expect it to gain that much attention.

In less than 24 hours, it reached over 50,000 views, with over 360 upvotes, 180 shares, and received more than 30 real use case ideas and suggestions for improvements.

The feedback seems to show there is a real need for better search and navigation in large projects, and it is helping shape the next steps and improve the user experience where it matters.

Next steps include adding configuration settings to customize search behavior, introducing a popup modal, multi-category filtering, search history and recent queries, and, as always, improvements and bug fixes.
