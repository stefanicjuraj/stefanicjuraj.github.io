Most of what I build is designed to solve my own problems first. And if others find value in it too, that's a bonus, but also a signal that the problem is worth solving.

My focus is always on building something useful, intuitive, lightweight, and transparent. No over-engineering, unnecessary complexity, or trying to keep attention with constant churn; just tools that work and continue to work without needing daily maintenance.

I started working on this portfolio website to encapsulate my projects in one place, along with short write-ups on why I built them and the problems they solve. For me, the value isn't just in showcasing the end product, but also in documenting the thought process and trade-offs behind it.
