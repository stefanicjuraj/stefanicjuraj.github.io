Most of what I build starts by solving my own problem. If others find it useful too, that's a bonus, and a sign that the problem is worth solving.

My focus is on building things that are useful, intuitive, lightweight, and transparent. I avoid over engineering, unnecessary complexity, and architectures that rely on constant activity or attention.

I am building this portfolio website to collect my projects in one place, with short notes on why they exist and the problems they address. The value for me is to have decisions, constraints, and thought processes documented along with the (un)finished work.

All my projects are on [GitHub](https://github.com/stefanicjuraj).

import DocCardList from "@theme/DocCardList";
import { useCurrentSidebarCategory } from "@docusaurus/theme-common";
