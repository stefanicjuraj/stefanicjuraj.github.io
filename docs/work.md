### [ReversingLabs](https://reversinglabs.com)

**Technical Writer / Documentation Engineer**

> April 2023 - Present

At ReversingLabs, my work revolves around building and maintaining a large-scale documentation platform for complex cybersecurity products. I develop and maintain [docs.reversinglabs.com](https://docs.reversinglabs.com), working primarily with Docusaurus and a modern JavaScript/React stack. Beyond writing documentation, I focus heavily on the surrounding infrastructure: automating build, staging, testing, and deployment workflows using GitLab CI/CD, YAML, Python, and Bash.

A significant part of my role involves implementing and maintaining OpenAPI specifications for API endpoints, using tools like Redocly and Swagger to ensure accuracy and usability. I regularly write changelogs and documentation updates alongside new releases, keeping the documentation aligned with the product’s development cycle.

### [Daytona](https://daytona.io)

**Technical Writer / Documentation Engineer**

> July 2024 - February 2025

At Daytona, I was responsible for developing and maintaining [daytona.io/docs](https://daytona.io/docs), built with Astro and a React-based frontend. Similar to my work elsewhere, I handled both content and tooling: setting up and maintaining automated build and deployment workflows using GitHub Actions, YAML, Python, and TypeScript.

My focus was on producing clear, concise documentation updates for new releases while keeping the documentation site fast, maintainable, and easy to navigate.

### [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://rit.edu)

**Software Engineer**

> September 2022 - May 2023

During my time at RIT, I worked on an asset inventory management web application for INA Group. I was involved in both frontend and backend development, using TypeScript, React, Express, and PostgreSQL. I designed and implemented the database schema and ensured the system could reliably track and manage assets.

In addition to development work, I documented project deliverables, requirements, and implementation details, treating documentation as a first-class artifact rather than a final step.

### [Cinnamon](https://www.cinnamon.agency/)

**Software Designer**

> April 2022 - September 2022

At Cinnamon, my role focused on designing UX and UI for an internal web application tool. I worked with Figma, Balsamiq, and Canva to prototype and iterate on designs, and collaborated closely with engineers to ensure feasibility and consistency.

I conducted user research and usability testing to validate design decisions and documented requirements, design rationales, and deliverables to provide a clear handover between design and implementation.

### [Syntio](https://syntio.net)

**Software Engineer**

> March 2021 - February 2022

At Syntio, I worked on an internal web application using TypeScript and React, while also contributing to the backend of an advanced data analytics platform running on Azure infrastructure. My work included processing, analyzing, and visualizing live data gathered via the Twitter API using Python, Java, Databricks, and PowerBI.

As with most of my roles, I documented system architecture, requirements, and implementation details in Markdown, ensuring that knowledge persisted beyond the immediate development cycle.
