Food that Nina and I like to make and eat. Nina is the one who does most of the cooking, and I am the one who does most of the eating. This also serves us as a reminder of what to eat when we are out of ideas.

I eventually want to make an app for us that will use this list as a database to generate recipes based on the ingredients we have on hand or we feel like eating. _Coming soon..._
