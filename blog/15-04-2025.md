Apparently, using an em dash (—), en dash (–), or hyphen (-) in a text is now used to classify it as AI-written.

<!-- truncate -->

I’ve been using em dashes for a long time — almost in every post I write. They help structure a sentence without breaking the flow by adding rhythm, clarity, and precision when used intentionally. Sometimes a comma feels too weak, and a period too final.

And although I agree that many AI-generated texts tend to overuse or misuse punctuation, it feels odd to instantly flag something so natural and useful as artificial. Writing styles vary. People think and write in different rhythms, and punctuation helps reflect that.
