I came across this idea of “ramblings” channels for remote teams. A dedicated place where each person can post thoughts, ideas, and updates without cluttering the main channels.

I use a similar approach every day, but without a dedicated channel. Most days I jot these down as messages to myself in Slack, or in plain .txt or .md files. They might be quick progress updates, thoughts on a feature, links worth saving, or half-formed ideas that could grow into something later.

It works because it keeps information flowing without needing a formal meeting or polished write-up. Small pieces of context add up over time, and those side thoughts often turn into solutions or improvements for the project.
