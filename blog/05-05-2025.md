Lately, I have been creating my own smaller applications to solve specific problems, instead of paying for products that either overcharge or overcomplicate simple tasks.

With the recent development of AI tools, and a lot of people vibe coding quick applications, there are now many tiny tools with insane pricing, wrapped in subscriptions, hidden data flows, and limited transparency often doing one or two things you could build yourself in a few hours.

Whenever possible, I try to follow the [file-over-app](https://stephango.com/file-over-app) philosophy: using a file that you own, store locally, and version yourself, instead of relying on external applications to manage it for you.

It's not just about saving money, it's about knowing exactly where your data goes, how your logic works, and avoiding adding another unknown dependency into your workflow.

I read this on a blog post somewhere and it resonated with me:

> "At some point, you're not paying for the product, you're paying to not open your code editor."
