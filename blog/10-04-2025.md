As someone who just recently started being involved in creating and tinkering with a lot of modern full stack web applications, I found this post by Andrej Karpathy spot-on.

When I committed fully into this, I was expecting (hoping) there to be an "out of the box" solution that would unite most of the tech stack needed to build a full stack web application: frontend, backend, database, authentication, deployment, CI/CD, hosting, analytics, monitoring, etc. Something opinionated enough to work together smoothly, but flexible enough not to get in the way. Instead, what you find is a loosely connected collection of services, libraries, and platforms, each solving a specific part, but requiring you to stitch everything together yourself.

What stands out the most is that once you start developing a full stack web application, the focus quickly shifts from coding to orchestrating. You’re suddenly not writing code anymore, but managing infrastructure, configurations, connections, and integrating services that don’t always work well together. Every small decision comes with a cascade of tradeoffs, options, and moving parts.

To add on, for most of these services you need to create separate accounts, connect them manually, read through the documentation, and maintain each integration individually. It’s rarely a one-time setup. APIs change, tokens expire, limits get hit, or logs need to be tracked down across dashboards. It's not just development anymore, it's constant context switching between platforms, each with its own UI, terminology, and behavior.

One small deviation from a “getting started” guide, and you’re deep in the internals of something you didn’t plan to learn that day. Most of the time, the issues aren’t even bugs, they’re misalignments between tools that weren’t built to work together by default.

None of these pieces are especially difficult in isolation. But connecting them, handling environment configuration, dealing with production errors, and maintaining reliability across updates takes more time and energy than expected.

Whoever solves this for both humans and AIs will unlock serious momentum.
