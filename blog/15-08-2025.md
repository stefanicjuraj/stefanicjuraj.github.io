title: Benchmarking Docusaurus OpenAPI Plugins

When maintaining developer documentation with tens, hundreds, or even thousands of API endpoints, performance becomes critical. To better understand how different OpenAPI plugins for Docusaurus handle large and small documentation sets, I ran a series of benchmarks comparing their ease of integration, build times, client-side performance, and rendering behavior.

Benchmarking plugins under these different conditions helps identify which ones maintain performance at scale. It helps spot potential bottlenecks early and choose a plugin that will remain reliable as the content expands.

## Plugins

### [redocusaurus](https://github.com/rohit-gohri/redocusaurus)

Redocusaurus is a preset for Docusaurus to help you integrate OpenAPI documentation via Redoc.

Redocusaurus delivered consistent build performance across all documentation sizes, handling larger sets without a steep drop in speed. Its integration process was straightforward, requiring minimal adjustments to fit into an existing Docusaurus setup. While initial page load performance could be improved, the plugin’s balance of stability, reasonable build times, and ease of configuration makes it a practical option for teams seeking reliable OpenAPI integration without extensive setup overhead.

### [openapi-docs](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/docusaurus-openapi-docs)

The docusaurus-plugin-openapi-docs package extends the Docusaurus CLI with commands for generating MDX using the OpenAPI specification as the source. The resulting MDX is fully compatible with plugin-content-docs and can be used to render beautiful reference API docs when combined with the docusaurus-theme-openapi-docs theme.

Openapi-docs offered strong compatibility with Docusaurus and provided extensive integration capabilities, making it well suited for complex documentation projects with advanced requirements. However, it recorded the slowest build times in this comparison, particularly with large documentation sets. This trade-off suggests that it is best suited for projects where rich feature support and flexibility are more important than build speed.

### [scalar@docusaurus](https://github.com/scalar/scalar/tree/main/integrations/docusaurus)

Scalar achieved the fastest build times in all tested scenarios, maintaining quick performance even with large documentation sets. Integration was straightforward, and the plugin produced clean, usable API documentation without requiring much additional configuration. Its performance advantage makes it a strong choice for projects where short iteration cycles and rapid rebuilds are a priority, though it offers fewer built-in customization options compared to more feature-heavy alternatives.

## Documentation sets

- **Small set**: 10 API endpoints
- **Medium set**: 100 API endpoints
- **Large set**: 1000 API endpoints

## Environment

- **Hardware**: MacBook Pro (Apple M1 Pro, 32 GB RAM)
- **Node.js**: v20.12.2
- **Docusaurus**: v3.3.2, @docusaurus/faster
- **Benchmark method**: Measured wall-clock time using the shell `time` command.
  - npm builds: `time npm run build`
  - Deno builds: `time deno task build`

## Metrics

These are the metrics I used to evaluate the plugins. They are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but I tried to keep them as independent as possible.

| Metric                      | Description                                                                                            |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Build time** (small set)  | Time to generate the full static site from source using a minimal documentation set, no cache present. |
| **Build time** (medium set) | Time to rebuild the site with a minimal documentation set using cached files.                          |
| **Build time** (large set)  | Time to generate the full static site from source using a large documentation set, no cache present.   |
| **Integration**             | Number of steps and adjustments needed to make the plugin work with an existing Docusaurus project.    |
| **Loading**                 | Time for the first page load after build.                                                              |
| **Configuration**           | Whether extra setup was necessary beyond basic installation (e.g. theme, customizations, etc.).        |
| **UX / UI**                 | How the plugin looks and feels in terms of design, layout, and usability.                              |

## Results

| Plugin                                                                                  | Build time (S) | Build time (M) | Build time (L) | Integration | Loading | Configuration | UX / UI |

Across the tested plugins, build performance varies significantly depending on the size of the documentation set. Scalar delivers the fastest builds overall, making it a strong choice for projects where short iteration cycles are a priority. Redocusaurus offered a balance between speed and ease of setup, performing reliably with both small and large sets. Openapi-docs produced the slowest builds in this comparison but provided comprehensive integration capabilities and strong compatibility with Docusaurus features. The results suggest that the optimal choice depends on whether build speed, integration flexibility, or feature completeness is the primary requirement.

These benchmarks aim to provide practical guidance for technical writers, developers, and documentation teams evaluating Docusaurus OpenAPI plugins.
